<h2 id="desc" class="list">The Music Circle Platform Ontology: Description <span class="backlink"> back to <a href="#toc">ToC</a></span></h2>
<span>
The ontology has been developed to support a set of tasks or facilities auch as: 

<ul class=itemize>
    <li>Descriptions of audio material in the system, including provenance and descriptions of its musical content and musicians involved.</li>
    <li>Comments made on the platform annotating certain parts of a performance, directed at specified students.</li>
    <li>Linking comments to the feedback classification encoded in the <a href="https://w3id.org/music-circle/grounded-ontology/1.0/" target="_blank">Music Circle Grounded Ontology</a>.</li>
    <li>Associating performances that are influenced by previous feedback to the comments made on the respective earlier performances.</li>
  </ul>


Figure 1 shows the platform ontology's main classes and properties. It reuses several existing ontologies, such as:
<ul class=itemize>
    <li>The <a href="http://musicontology.com/" target="_blank">Music Ontology</a> for the description of music-related data, such as compositions, music performances, and audio recordings.</li>
    <li>The <a href="http://motools.sf.net/timeline/timeline.html" target="_blank">Timeline Ontology</a> for identifying temporal instants and intervals on the audio timeline.</li>
    <li>The <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/prov-o/" target="_blank">PROV Ontology</a> for capturing users (agents) and user activity.</li>
  </ul>
