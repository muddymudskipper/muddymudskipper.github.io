<span>

 The Music Circle Grounded Ontology has been developed using a grounded theory method. The annotations made by the students and tutors involved in a case study were the input to the analysis. An annotation on an audio file of a music performance has a reference to which audio file it pertains, a start point, an end point, a username and a text-based comment. The aim was to create a set of categories that effectively described the set of annotations, starting with an empty set. Thus the set of categories is grounded in the data, not in an external theory. The process in creating the grounded ontology is as follows:

 <ul class=itemize>
        <li>Select 10% of the ~2000 annotations.</li> 
        <li>For each annotation, select applicable categories from the existing set of categories (a set which starts off empty).</li> 
        <li>Create and apply new categories if the annotation has not been sufficiently categorised.</li> 
        <li>Re-apply any newly created categories back to previously categorised annotations where they apply.</li>  
        <li>Continue until all of the initial 10% have been categorised.</li>  
        <li>Validate the category set by iterating over the uncategorised annotations and applying the categories. If category set is insufficient, repeat the process above with another subset of the annotations.</li>  
    </ul>
 
 The output of the grounded discourse analysis resulted in this formal OWL ontology. For details about the ontology design and functionality see <a href="#ref1">[1]</a>.
